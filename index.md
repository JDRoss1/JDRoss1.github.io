Making your bed correctly will help you to get a good night's sleep.

# Prerequisites
First you need to remove everything from the bed. Be sure to remove pillows, toys, comforter, etc.
Take the duvet/blanket off, the top sheet and any pillows and place them aside on a chair.

1. If the fitted sheet is not already on the bed, you will need to put it on. Do this by tucking the elasticated ends of the sheet around the corners of the mattress.
1. Put the top sheet on. Make sure the top sheet is spread evenly over the mattress, with the same length of sheet hanging over both sides of the bed.
1. Fold the sheet under the mattress at the two bottom corners. This will make it fit nice and tight.
1. Place the duvet or comforter on top. Once the top sheet is tucked in place, you can lay your blankets, duvet or comforter on top.

> *Note*: There's a method for folding the end of the top sheet tightly under the mattress.  It is the trickiest step in making a bed, but it is also the part which will make your bed look neatest. It is called "hospital corner". See [Make Your Bed](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Bed)
